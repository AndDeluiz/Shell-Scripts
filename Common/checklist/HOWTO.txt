To use these scripts, they must first be copied to the target system to
be verified, which can be done as follows:

First SSH to one of the Kickstart Servers: 153.6.60.62 or 10.203.236.1

    # ssh <9id>@<NIMServer> or <KickstartServer>
    # cd /scripts/checklist-3.2

Next, copy the checklist-3.2 directory to the target system.

    # scp -r /scripts/checklist-3.2  9id@targetSystemHostName:/usr/local/scripts/checklist-3.2

Now logout from the NIM server, and login to the target system.

    # ssh 9id@targetSystemHostName
    # cd /usr/local/scripts/checklist-3.2

Edit the "runthis.sh" or "runthis.bash" script to contain the RITM,
username, and location information you want displayed in the checklist
verification output. Also include the Verification group command line
options if you want to use Verification groups:

    # vi ./runthis.sh      #### Run this for AIX or Linux systems with Korn Shell 93
    # vi ./runthis.bash    #### Run this for Linux systems with bash

Execute the verification script to generate CSV or HTML output.

NOTE: It may be necessary to modify the FPATH and CONFDIR variables in
the script named "checklist.zbksh" to reflect the directory in which
they exist.

    # ./runthis.sh      #### Run this for AIX or Linux systems with Korn Shell 93
    # ./runthis.bash    #### Run this for Linux systems with bash

The output from these scripts will be generated in the "/tmp" directory and
will have a file name of "RITM0000000_hostname_checklist.html"
